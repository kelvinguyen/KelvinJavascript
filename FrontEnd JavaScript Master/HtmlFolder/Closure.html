            <h5>Explain the image above</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The browser will create the SUM variable and point to a function {fn} . Then the {fn} PROTOTYPE will point to object. At this point, javascript will not know what is inside the {fn}.
                </li>
                <li>
                    browser will create variable a with the value of 1
                </li>
                <li>
                    browser will create object b and this object will have val variable with value 2
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, the sum function is evaluated. local scope variable x is assign value of 1, and y is point to object b
                </li>
                <li>
                    now, inside the function is evaluated. x = 2 and b.value = 3
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then c variable is created and has the result of function as 5
                </li>
                <li>
                    x,y is out of scope and gabage collection remove it
                    finally, the result will display as follow
                    a = 1;
                    b = 3;
                    c = 5;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Closure</h3>
            <p>
                A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables
